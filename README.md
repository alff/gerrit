Usage
=====

server
----

Installs/Configures gerrit

```json
"run_list": [
    "recipe[gerrit::server]"
]
```

1. Download 'java' coobook from opscode community or from my github account.
2. Create role 'java' and set preffered flavor of java ('openjdk' or 'sun') in role attrinutes and upload it on chef server.
    Example:
            {
              "name": "java",
              "description": "",
              "json_class": "Chef::Role",
              "default_attributes": {
               },
              "override_attributes": {
                "java": {
                  "oracle": {
                     "accept_oracle_download_terms": true
                        },
                  "install_flavor": "oracle"
                  }
               },
              "chef_type": "role",
              "run_list": [
              "recipe[java]"
              ],
              "env_run_lists": {
               }
            }

(see manual for 'java' cookbook)

3. Create role gerrit.
    Example:
            {
              "name": "gerrit",
              "description": "",
              "json_class": "Chef::Role",
              "default_attributes": {
              },
              "override_attributes": {
                "gerrit": {
                   "db": {
                     "type": "MYSQL"
                    },
                   "auth_type": "OPENID"
                }
              },
            "chef_type": "role",
            "run_list": [
               "role[java]",
                  "recipe[gerrit::server]"
            ],
            "env_run_lists": {
              }
           }

!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!
Temporary at first run attributes from role 'gerrit' doesn't work because they are saving when recipe compile time starts. But attributes from recipe are trying
to check variable of attribute from role. Espesially dbtype and auth method. Need to set it manualy.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Upload roles on chef server and attach role 'gerrit' to target node.
5. Start chef-client
